## Main lines of research

### * Observation and study of long-term variations in the pelagic ecosystem. Time series.
- Changes in abundance and diversity of plankton and micronekton as a function of the environment.
  
### The role of plankton and micronekton and their diversity in biogeochemical cycles and food webs.
- Biomass, composition and dynamics of the different components.
- Trophic networks. Biomass transfer. Recycling vs. export.
- Biogeochemistry: C, N, P and Si cycles. Biological pump.
  
### Ecology and evolution of plankton.
- Theoretical ecology and numerical simulations focused on ecological niches and future scenarios.
  
### Deep-sea benthic ecology, diversity and conservation.
- Vulnerable deep-sea marine ecosystems, cold water corals. 
- Distribution, ecophysiology, functionality, benthic-pelagic coupling, associated diversity and conservation
  
### Development of underwater acoustic methodology.
- Development of algorithms and processing for echogram cleaning, noise estimation, species identification, target strength, data reduction, broadband, deep acoustic profilers, multibeam...
